title: About Me

Hello! I'm Eric and here's the boring part of my page where I talk a little bit about myself. Starting this Fall, I will be a first year Statistics Ph.D student at Texas A&M. I love working on data-related problems, and I think in the intersection of statistics and computer science present lie many unsolved problems whose solutions, when discovered, will revolutionize the world. In particular, I'm interested in problems related to computer vision, artificial intelligence, and the scalability of machine learning algorithms. Feel free to check out my resume [here](http://echuu.github.io/assets/resume.pdf). If you're interested in working with me, feel free to drop me a message!
