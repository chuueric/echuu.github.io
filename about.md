I'm going to start the first year of Statistics Ph.D program at Texas A&M in the Fall. I love working on data-related problems, and I think in the intersection of statistics and computer science lies many unsolved problems that can revolutionize the world. Problems that interest me are ones that are related to computer vision and scalability of machine learning algorithms. Feel free to check out my [resume](http://echuu.github.io/assets/resume.pdf).
